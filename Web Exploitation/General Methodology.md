## Introduction
Web challenges in Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions are designed to test participants' skills in web application security. These challenges typically involve identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities present in web applications, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and server-side request forgery (SSRF). By solving these challenges, players learn to identify and exploit common security flaws in web applications, enhancing their understanding of web security principles and techniques.

## Website Assessment
- When given an IP address and port number in a web challenge, or when discovering ports 80 and/or 443 open on a target, you should begin thinking about how you should assess a web application or web page. 

### View Source Code
- There may be a case where you are given a website to assess. Here's an example of what it may look like:


![Basic Webpage](https://github.com/APSUCyberClub/CTF-Playbooks/assets/60797871/8c5bd71b-3ad3-4b4d-b9df-7ca866577ba7)


- One of the first steps that I follow when I access a web page for a CTF event is view the source code. This can be done by right clicking and selecting the "View page source" option, or by pressing `Ctrl + u` on the keyboard. Here is an example of what you may see when viewing the web page source content for the example page above:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head></head>

<h1>Welcome to my webpage!</h1>
<h3>Where is the flag?</h3>
<!--- flag{y0u_f0und_m3!} --->
<h5>Read between the lines!</h5>
```

- Flags or relevant clues are often hid inside the page source via html comments, as denoted by the <!--text-->
- These comments aren't shown when the page is loaded, so it can misdirect people. It is important to note that this is a basic example and not a comprehensive guide. 
### Robots.txt
- A robots.txt file may be visible on some web pages. A robots.txt file is designed to tell web crawlers like Google to not index certain directories on the web server. Sometimes, this may contain information regarding hidden directories that can be viewed for further clues. 
- To view what a robots.txt file will look like on a web server, you could go to https://ctflearn.com/robots.txt
- Here you will see a hidden directory that won't be indexed by web bots. Try and navigate to it and see what you find!
### View JavaScript/CSS Files
**1. Accessing Developer Tools:**
- Most modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.) come with built-in developer tools. You can usually access them by right-clicking on the webpage and selecting "Inspect" or by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + I` (or `Cmd + Opt + I` on Mac).
**2. Elements Tab:**
- The Elements tab allows you to view and modify the HTML and CSS of the webpage.
- Look for hidden elements, comments, or unusual tags that may contain clues.
- Check for inline JavaScript code or event listeners that could trigger hidden functionality.
- Examine the classes and IDs of elements, as they may be used in CSS or JavaScript puzzles.
**3. Console Tab:**
- The Console tab displays error messages, warnings, and allows you to execute JavaScript code.
- Look for any messages that could contain hints or clues.
- Experiment with executing JavaScript commands to interact with the page dynamically.
**4. Network Tab:**
- The Network tab shows all the requests made by the webpage, including AJAX requests and resource downloads.
- Look for hidden endpoints or files that could contain clues.
- Pay attention to response headers or payloads for hidden messages.
**5. Sources Tab:**
- The Sources tab allows you to view and debug JavaScript files.
- Look for obfuscated code, hidden functions, or hardcoded strings that may reveal clues.
- Set breakpoints to pause JavaScript execution and inspect variables or the call stack.
**6. Application Tab (Chrome):**
- The Application tab is specific to Chrome and allows you to inspect cookies, local storage, and session storage.
- Look for hidden values or tokens stored in cookies or local storage.
- Manipulate values to bypass authentication or access restricted areas.

### Examples of Techniques in CTF:
**1. Source Code Analysis:**
- Inspect the page source for comments, hidden HTML elements, or JavaScript functions that may contain clues or hints.
- Look for base64 encoded strings that could be decoded to reveal hidden messages.
**2. Hidden Endpoints:**
- Use the Network tab to identify AJAX requests or API endpoints that are not directly linked from the webpage.
- Analyze the request and response payloads for potential clues or vulnerabilities.
**3. Client-Side Validation Bypass:**
- Identify client-side validation scripts in the page source.
- Use the Console tab to modify JavaScript variables or bypass validation checks to access restricted functionality.
**4. Cookie Manipulation:**
- Use the Application tab to inspect cookies and modify their values.
- Look for session tokens or authentication cookies that could be manipulated to gain unauthorized access.
**5. Steganography:**
- Use the Elements tab to inspect images, backgrounds, or other media elements for hidden messages using steganography techniques.
**6. JavaScript Analysis:**
- Analyze JavaScript files in the Sources tab for obfuscated code, hidden functions, or hardcoded values.
- Use breakpoints to pause execution and inspect the runtime behavior of the code.

### JavaScript and Console Interactions
Here are some examples of JavaScript code and commands that you can enter into the console tab of the developer tools to interact with and inspect a web page:

**1. Document Manipulation:**
```js
// Change the title of the webpage
document.title = "New Title";  
// Hide an element by ID 
document.getElementById("elementID").style.display = "none";  
// Change the content of an element by ID 
document.getElementById("elementID").innerHTML = "New Content";
```

**2. DOM Traversal:**
```js
// Get all elements with a specific class 
var elements = document.getElementsByClassName("className");
// Get the parent element of a specified element
var parentElement = document.getElementById("childElement").parentNode;  
// Get the next sibling element of a specified element 
var nextSibling = document.getElementById("elementID").nextSibling;
```

**3. Cookie Manipulation:**
```js
// Set a cookie
document.cookie = "name=value";
// Get all cookies 
var allCookies = document.cookie;  
// Delete a cookie 
document.cookie = "name=; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 UTC; path=/;";
```

**4. Event Simulation:**
```js
// Simulate a click event on an element by ID
document.getElementById("buttonID").click();  
// Trigger a custom event 
var event = new Event("customEvent"); document.dispatchEvent(event);
```

**5. Console Output:**
```js
// Log a message to the console 
console.log("Hello, world!"); 
// Log an object to the console 
var obj = { key: "value" }; console.log(obj);  
// Log a warning message to the console 
console.warn("This is a warning!");
```

**6. Network Requests:**
```js
// Send a GET request to a URL 
fetch("https://example.com/api/data")     
.then(response => response.json())     
.then(data => console.log(data))     
.catch(error => console.error("Error:", error));
```

These examples demonstrate just a few of the many things you can do with JavaScript in the browser console. Experimenting with these commands and techniques can help you understand and interact with web pages more effectively during tasks like web debugging, testing, or participating in CTF competitions.
